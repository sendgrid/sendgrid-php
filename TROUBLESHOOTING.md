## Migrating from v2 to v3

In this context, we are referring to the version of the SendGrid API.

Please review [our guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Classroom/Send/v3_Mail_Send/how_to_migrate_from_v2_to_v3_mail_send.html) on how to migrate from v2 to v3.

<a name="v2"></a>
## Continue Using v2

In this context, we are referring to the version of the SendGrid API.

[Here](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/releases/tag/v4.0.4) is the last working version with v2 support.

Using composer:

```json
{
  "require": {
    "sendgrid/sendgrid": "~4.0.4"
  }
}
```

<a name="testing"></a>
## Testing v3 /mail/send Calls Directly

[Here](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Classroom/Send/v3_Mail_Send/curl_examples.html) are some cURL examples for common use cases.

<a name="error"></a>
## Error Messages

Failed requests will always return an error response, including a response code, a message explaining the reason for the error, and a link to any relevant documentation that may help you troubleshoot the problem.

To read the error message returned by SendGrid's API:

```php
try {
    $response = $sendgrid->send($email);
    print $response->statusCode() . "\n"; 
    print_r($response->headers());
    print $response->body() . "\n"; // SendGrid specific errors are found here
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Caught exception: ',  $e->getMessage(), "\n";
}
```

You may find complete documentation [here](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Mail/errors.html).

<a name="versions"></a>
## Versions

We follow the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning scheme as described by [SemVer.org](http://semver.org). Therefore, we recommend that you always pin (or vendor) the particular version you are working with to your code and never auto-update to the latest version. Especially when there is a MAJOR point release, since that is guaranteed to be a breaking change. Changes are documented in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and [releases](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/releases) section.

<a name="environment"></a>
## Environment Variables and Your SendGrid API Key

All of our examples assume you are using [environment variables](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php#setup-environment-variables) to hold your SendGrid API key.

If you choose to add your SendGrid API key directly (not recommended):

`$apiKey = getenv('SENDGRID_API_KEY');`

becomes

`$apiKey = 'SENDGRID_API_KEY';`

In the first case SENDGRID_API_KEY is in reference to the name of the environment variable, while the second case references the actual SendGrid API Key.

<a name="package-manager"></a>
## Using the Package Manager

We upload this library to [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/sendgrid/sendgrid) whenever we make a release. This allows you to use [composer](https://getcomposer.org) for easy installation.

In most cases we recommend you download the latest version of the library, but if you need a different version, please use:

```json
{
  "require": {
    "sendgrid/sendgrid": "~X.X.X"
  }
}
```

<a name="error-415"></a>
## Fixing Error 415

If you're getting the following error while using this library:

`Content-Type should be application/json.`

It is most likely due to a linebreak in your API key. Passing your key through `trim` should fix this:

`$apiKey = trim($apiKey)`

<a name="request-body"></a>
## Viewing the Request Body

When debugging or testing, it may be useful to examine the raw request body to compare against the [documented format](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/api_v3.html).

You can do this right before you call `$response = $sg->send($email);` like so:

```php
echo json_encode($email, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);
```

## Google App Engine installation

Please refer to [`USE_CASES.md`](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/blob/master/USE_CASES.md#GAE-instructions) for additional instructions.
