## [7.0.0] - 2018-05-19 ##
### BREAKING CHANGE

Thanks to the [strong support and feedback of the SendGrid PHP community](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/issues/434), we have a new version of this SDK that should be a big improvement in the developer experience for this SDK.

In particular, I'd like to make special mention of [@caseyw](https://github.com/caseyw), [@vitya1](https://github.com/vitya1), [@Braunson](https://github.com/Braunson), [@cbschuld](https://github.com/cbschuld), [@paoga87](https://github.com/paoga87), [@Taluu](https://github.com/Taluu), [@mazanax](https://github.com/mazanax), [@ninsuo](https://github.com/ninsuo), [@ianh2](https://github.com/ianh2), [@WadeShuler](https://github.com/WadeShuler), [@jaimehing](https://github.com/jaimehing), [@KnightAR](https://github.com/KnightAR), [@alextech](https://github.com/alextech) (my apologies if I've missed you)

Since this is a major departure from v6.X, we advise you refactor your code according to the documentation found in the [README](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/blob/master/README.md) and [USE_CASES](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/blob/master/USE_CASES.md) files. We hope you find the new interface much easier to work with. Please open an [issue](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/issues) or PR if you run into any trouble or have any feedback. 

If you wish to continue using previous versions of this SDK, no problem. However, we will not be updating versions less than v7 except for critical bugs and/or security issues.

We hope this will be the last breaking change in the foreseeable future; that said, let the iterations begin!
