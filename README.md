**This library allows you to quickly and easily use the Twilio SendGrid Web API v3 via PHP.**

Version 7.X.X of this library provides full support for all Twilio SendGrid [Web API v3](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/index.html) endpoints, including the new [v3 /mail/send](https://sendgrid.com/blog/introducing-v3mailsend-sendgrids-new-mail-endpoint).

We want this library to be community driven and Twilio SendGrid led. Your help is needed to realize this goal. To help make sure we are building the right things in the right order, we ask that you create [issues](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/issues) and [pull requests](CONTRIBUTING.md) or simply upvote or comment on existing issues or pull requests.

Please browse the rest of this README for further details.

We appreciate your continued support, thank you!

# Installation

## Prerequisites

- PHP version 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, or 7.4
- The Twilio SendGrid service, starting at the [free level](https://sendgrid.com/free?source=sendgrid-php) to send up to 40,000 emails for the first 30 days, then send 100 emails/day free forever or check out [our pricing](https://sendgrid.com/pricing?source=sendgrid-php).
- For SMS messages, you will need a free [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio?source=sendgrid-php).

## Setup Environment Variables

Update the development environment with your [SENDGRID_API_KEY](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys), for example:

1. Copy the sample env file to a new file named `.env`
```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```
2. Edit the `.env` file to include your `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
3. Source the `.env` file
```bash
source ./.env
```

## Install Package

Add Twilio SendGrid to your `composer.json` file. If you are not using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org), we highly recommend it. It's an excellent way to manage dependencies in your PHP application.

```json
{
  "require": {
    "sendgrid/sendgrid": "~7"
  }
}
```

### Alternative: Install package from zip

If you are not using Composer, simply download and install the **[latest packaged release of the library as a zip](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/releases/download/7.11.2/sendgrid-php.zip)**.

[**⬇︎ Download Packaged Library ⬇︎**](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/releases/download/7.11.2/sendgrid-php.zip)

Previous versions of the library can be downloaded directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/releases).

## Dependencies

- The Twilio SendGrid Service, starting at the [free level](https://sendgrid.com/free?source=sendgrid-php)
- The dependency-free [php-http-client](https://github.com/sendgrid/php-http-client)

<a name="quick-start"></a>
# Quick Start

Include the proper lines from below at the top of each example based on your installation method:

```php
<?php
// Uncomment the next line if you're using a dependency loader (such as Composer) (recommended)
// require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// Uncomment the next line if you're not using a dependency loader (such as Composer), replacing <PATH TO> with the path to the sendgrid-php.php file
// require_once '<PATH TO>/sendgrid-php.php';
```

## Hello Email

The following is the minimum needed code to send an email. You may find more examples in our USE_CASES file:

```php
$email = new \SendGrid\Mail\Mail();
$email->setFrom("test@example.com", "Example User");
$email->setSubject("Sending with Twilio SendGrid is Fun");
$email->addTo("test@example.com", "Example User");
$email->addContent("text/plain", "and easy to do anywhere, even with PHP");
$email->addContent(
    "text/html", "<strong>and easy to do anywhere, even with PHP</strong>"
);
$sendgrid = new \SendGrid(getenv('SENDGRID_API_KEY'));
try {
    $response = $sendgrid->send($email);
    print $response->statusCode() . "\n";
    print_r($response->headers());
    print $response->body() . "\n";
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Caught exception: '. $e->getMessage() ."\n";
}
```

The `SendGrid\Mail` constructor creates a [personalization object](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Classroom/Send/v3_Mail_Send/personalizations.html) for you. [Here](USE_CASES.md#kitchen-sink) is an example of how to add to it.

## General v3 Web API Usage (With Fluent Interface)

```php
$apiKey = getenv('SENDGRID_API_KEY');
$sg = new \SendGrid($apiKey);

try {
    $response = $sg->client->suppression()->bounces()->get();
    print $response->statusCode() . "\n";
    print_r($response->headers());
    print $response->body() . "\n";
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Caught exception: '.  $e->getMessage(). "\n";
}
```

## General v3 Web API Usage (Without Fluent Interface)

```php
$apiKey = getenv('SENDGRID_API_KEY');
$sg = new \SendGrid($apiKey);

try {
    $response = $sg->client->_("suppression/bounces")->get();
    print $response->statusCode() . "\n";
    print_r($response->headers());
    print $response->body() . "\n";
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Caught exception: '.  $e->getMessage(). "\n";
}
```
