All updates to this library is documented in our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

# Installation

## Prerequisites

- PHP version 5.6 or 7.0
- The SendGrid service, starting at the [free level](https://sendgrid.com/free?source=sendgrid-php)

## Setup Environment Variables

Update your environment with your [SENDGRID_API_KEY](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys).

```bash
echo "export SENDGRID_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'" > sendgrid.env
echo "sendgrid.env" >> .gitignore
source ./sendgrid.env
```

## Install Package

Add SendGrid to your `composer.json` file. If you are not using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org), you should be. It's an excellent way to manage dependencies in your PHP application.

```json
{
  "require": {
    "sendgrid/sendgrid": "~5.0.5"
  }
}
```

Then at the top of your PHP script require the autoloader:

```bash
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

#### Alternative: Install package from zip

If you are not using Composer, simply download and install the **[latest packaged release of the library as a zip](https://sendgrid-open-source.s3.amazonaws.com/sendgrid-php/sendgrid-php.zip)**.

[**⬇︎ Download Packaged Library ⬇︎**](https://sendgrid-open-source.s3.amazonaws.com/sendgrid-php/sendgrid-php.zip)

Then require the library from package:

```php
require("path/to/sendgrid-php/sendgrid-php.php");
```

Previous versions of the library can be found in the [version index](https://sendgrid-open-source.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

## Dependencies

- The SendGrid Service, starting at the [free level](https://sendgrid.com/free?source=sendgrid-php)
- [php-HTTP-Client](https://github.com/sendgrid/php-http-client)

# Quick Start

## Hello Email

```php
<?php
// If you are using Composer
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// If you are not using Composer (recommended)
// require("path/to/sendgrid-php/sendgrid-php.php");

$from = new SendGrid\Email(null, "test@example.com");
$subject = "Hello World from the SendGrid PHP Library";
$to = new SendGrid\Email(null, "test@example.com");
$content = new SendGrid\Content("text/plain", "some text here");
$mail = new SendGrid\Mail($from, $subject, $to, $content);

$apiKey = getenv('SENDGRID_API_KEY');
$sg = new \SendGrid($apiKey);

$response = $sg->client->mail()->send()->post($mail);
echo $response->statusCode();
echo $response->headers();
echo $response->body();
```

## General v3 Web API Usage

```php
<?php
// If you are using Composer (recommended)
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// If you are not using Composer
// require("path/to/sendgrid-php/sendgrid-php.php");

$apiKey = getenv('SENDGRID_API_KEY');
$sg = new \SendGrid($apiKey);

$response = $sg->client->api_keys()->get();

print $response->statusCode();
print $response->headers();
print $response->body();
```
