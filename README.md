**NEW:** Subscribe to email [notifications](https://dx.sendgrid.com/newsletter/php) for releases and breaking changes.

**This library allows you to quickly and easily use the SendGrid Web API v3 via PHP.**

Version 7.X.X of this library provides full support for all SendGrid [Web API v3](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/index.html) endpoints, including the new [v3 /mail/send](https://sendgrid.com/blog/introducing-v3mailsend-sendgrids-new-mail-endpoint).

We want this library to be community driven and SendGrid led. Your help is needed to realize this goal. To help make sure we are building the right things in the right order, we ask that you create [issues](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) or simply upvote or comment on existing issues or pull requests.

Please browse the rest of this README for further details.

We appreciate your continued support, thank you!

# Installation

## Prerequisites

- PHP version 5.6, 7.0, 7.1 or 7.2
- The SendGrid service, starting at the [free level](https://sendgrid.com/free?source=sendgrid-php)

## Setup Environment Variables

Update the development environment with your [SENDGRID_API_KEY](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys), for example:

1. Copy the sample env file to a new file named `.env`
```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```
2. Edit the `.env` file to include your `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
3. Source the `.env` file
```bash
source ./.env
```

## Install Package

Add SendGrid to your `composer.json` file. If you are not using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org), we highly recommend it. It's an excellent way to manage dependencies in your PHP application.

```json
{
  "require": {
    "sendgrid/sendgrid": "~7"
  }
}
```

#### Alternative: Install package from zip

If you are not using Composer, simply download and install the **[latest packaged release of the library as a zip](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/releases/download/v7.0.0/sendgrid-php.zip)**.

[**⬇︎ Download Packaged Library ⬇︎**](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/releases/download/v7.0.0/sendgrid-php.zip)

Previous versions of the library can be found in the [version index](https://sendgrid-open-source.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) or downloaded directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/releases).

## Dependencies

- The SendGrid Service, starting at the [free level](https://sendgrid.com/free?source=sendgrid-php)
- The dependency free [php-http-client](https://github.com/sendgrid/php-http-client)

# Quick Start

## Hello Email

The following is the minimum needed code to send an email. You may find more examples in our USE_CASES file:

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php'; // If you're using Composer (recommended)
// Comment out the above line if not using Composer
// require("./sendgrid-php.php"); 
// If not using Composer, uncomment the above line

$email = new \SendGrid\Mail\Mail(); 
$email->setFrom("test@example.com", "Example User");
$email->setSubject("Sending with SendGrid is Fun");
$email->addTo("test@example.com", "Example User");
$email->addContent("text/plain", "and easy to do anywhere, even with PHP");
$email->addContent(
    "text/html", "<strong>and easy to do anywhere, even with PHP</strong>"
);
$sendgrid = new \SendGrid(getenv('SENDGRID_API_KEY'));
try {
    $response = $sendgrid->send($email);
    print $response->statusCode() . "\n";
    print_r($response->headers());
    print $response->body() . "\n";
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Caught exception: ',  $e->getMessage(), "\n";
}
```

The `SendGrid\Mail` constructor creates a [personalization object](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Classroom/Send/v3_Mail_Send/personalizations.html) for you. [Here](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/blob/master/USE_CASES.md#kitchen-sink) is an example of how to add to it.

## General v3 Web API Usage (With Fluent Interface)

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php'; // If you're using Composer (recommended)
// Comment out the above line if not using Composer
// require("./sendgrid-php.php"); 
// If not using Composer, uncomment the above line

$apiKey = getenv('SENDGRID_API_KEY');
$sg = new \SendGrid($apiKey);

try {
    $response = $sg->client->suppression()->bounces()->get();
    print $response->statusCode() . "\n";
    print_r($response->headers());
    print $response->body() . "\n";
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Caught exception: ',  $e->getMessage(), "\n";
}
```

## General v3 Web API Usage (Without Fluent Interface)

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php'; // If you're using Composer (recommended)
// Comment out the above line if not using Composer
// require("./sendgrid-php.php"); 
// If not using Composer, uncomment the above line

$apiKey = getenv('SENDGRID_API_KEY');
$sg = new \SendGrid($apiKey);

try {
    $response = $sg->client->_("suppression/bounces")->get();
    print $response->statusCode() . "\n";
    print_r($response->headers());
    print $response->body() . "\n";
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Caught exception: ',  $e->getMessage(), "\n";
}
```
